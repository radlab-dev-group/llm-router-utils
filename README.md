# llm‑router‑utils

## What is it?

`llm-router-utils` is a collection of ready‑made **tools and examples** built on top of **LLM‑Router** – a flexible
language‑model router. The repository contains:

* **Ready‑to‑run examples** – scripts, configurations, and small applications that you can simply clone and execute.
* **Universal tools** – useful in many areas (data analysis, text processing, content protection, etc.).
* **Minimal setup** – everything you need is in the repository; after cloning, just run a few commands.

---

## Why use it?

* **Fast start** – you don’t have to build infrastructure from scratch; all components are already prepared.
* **Modularity** – you can pick only the parts you need and easily combine them.
* **Extensibility** – thanks to LLM‑Router you can plug in any model (local, cloud‑based, custom service) and take
  advantage of built‑in load‑balancing strategies.
